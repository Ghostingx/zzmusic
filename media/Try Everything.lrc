[00:15.54]I messed up tonight, I lost another fight
[00:20.10]I still mess up but I'll just start again
[00:23.68]I keep falling down, I keep on hitting the ground
[00:28.19]I always get up now to see what's next
[00:33.50]Birds don't just fly, they fall down and get up
[00:41.63]Nobody learns without getting it won
[00:49.19]I won't give up, no I won't give in
[00:52.82]Til I reach the end, then I'll start again
[00:57.22]No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
[01:01.22]I wanna try even though I could fail
[01:05.75]I won't give up, no I won't give in
[01:09.71]Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
[01:13.69]No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
[01:17.85]I wanna try even though I could fail

[01:39.11]Look at how far you've come, you filled your heart with love
[01:42.91]Baby you've done enough that cut your breath
[01:47.37]Don't beat yourself up, don't need to run so fast
[01:51.47]Sometimes we come last, but we did our best
[01:55.88]I won't give up, no I won't give in
[01:59.30]Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
[02:03.69]No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
[02:07.59]I wanna try even though I could fail
[02:12.41]I won't give up, no I won't give in
[02:15.69]Til I reach the end and then I'll start again
[02:20.07]No I won't leave, I wanna try everything
[02:24.35]I wanna try even though I could fail
[02:29.88]I'll keep on making those new mistakes
[02:38.13]I'll keep on making them every day
[02:46.01]Those new mistakes
[02:50.46]Oh oh oh oh oooh
[02:53.08]Try everything
[02:54.82]Oh oh oh oh oooh
